# Platform File Map

This page lists the Coding file locations in a user project. Coding targets
Claude Code only, so all platform files live under `.claude/`.

## Layout

| Item           | CLI flag             | Directory               |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Main directory | `--claude` (default) | `.claude/`              |
| Skills         |                      | `.claude/skills/`       |
| Agents         |                      | `.claude/agents/`       |
| Hooks          |                      | `.claude/hooks/`        |
| Settings       |                      | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Commands       |                      | `.claude/commands/`     |

## Coding Sub-Agents

Claude Code has `coding-research`, `coding-implement`, and `coding-check` agent
files under `.claude/agents/`. When changing implementation/check/research
behavior, look at those agent files first.

## Decision Rules When Modifying Platform Files

1. Modify files under `.claude/` unless shared workflow/spec files must also change.
2. User wants project rules: prefer `.coding/spec/` or a project-local skill.
3. User wants Coding behavior: edit `.coding/workflow.md` plus `.claude/` hooks/agents/skills/commands.

## When Paths Differ

User projects may already be customized. If this layout disagrees with local
files, use the actual settings/config in the user project as authoritative:

- Check the hook that `.claude/settings.json` registers.
- Check the script that a command points to.
- Judge behavior by the read rules currently written in the agent file.

Do not delete a custom file just because it is not listed in this path table.
