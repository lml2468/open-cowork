# Local Files Generated After Init

`coding init` writes the Coding runtime into the user project. Later, `coding update` tries to update Coding-managed template files, but it uses `.coding/.template-hashes.json` to determine which files have already been modified by the user.

This page only describes files that are visible and editable inside the user project.

## `.coding/`

```text

| Path                            | Usually editable? | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.coding/workflow.md`           | Yes               | Local workflow documentation and AI routing rules.                                 |
| `.coding/config.yaml`           | Yes               | Project configuration, hooks, packages, journal line limits, and related settings. |
| `.coding/spec/`                 | Yes               | Project specs, intended to be updated regularly by users and AI.                   |
| `.coding/tasks/`                | Yes               | Task material and research artifacts, maintained by the task workflow.             |
| `.coding/workspace/`            | Yes               | Session records, usually written by `add_session.py`.                              |
| `.coding/scripts/`              | Carefully         | Local runtime. It can be customized, but only after understanding the call chain.  |
| `.coding/.runtime/`             | No                | Runtime state, usually written automatically by hooks/scripts.                     |
| `.coding/.developer`            | Carefully         | Current developer identity.                                                        |
| `.coding/.version`              | No                | Coding version record used by update/migration logic.                              |
| `.coding/.template-hashes.json` | No                | Template hash record. Do not hand-write business rules here.                       |

## Platform Directory

Coding targets Claude Code, so all platform files live under `.claude/`:

| Category | Paths                   | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hooks    | `.claude/hooks/`        | Inject session context, workflow-state, and sub-agent context.                   |
| settings | `.claude/settings.json` | Tell the platform when to run hooks.                                             |
| agents   | `.claude/agents/`       | Define agents such as `coding-research`, `coding-implement`, and `coding-check`. |
| skills   | `.claude/skills/`       | Skills that auto-trigger or can be read by AI.                                   |
| commands | `.claude/commands/`     | Explicit user-invoked command entry points.                                      |

When modifying the `.claude/` directory, also confirm whether `.coding/workflow.md` still describes the same flow.

## Meaning Of Template Hashes

`.coding/.template-hashes.json` records the content hash from the last time Coding wrote a template file. `coding update` uses it to distinguish three cases:

| Case                                 | Update behavior                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File was not modified by the user    | It can be updated automatically.                                       |
| File was modified by the user        | Prompt the user to overwrite, keep, or generate `.new`.                |
| File is no longer a current template | It may be deleted, renamed, or preserved according to migration rules. |

When an AI customizes local Coding files, it does not need to maintain hashes manually. It is normal for Coding update to recognize the result as "modified by the user."

## Local Customization Boundaries

Editable by default:

- `.coding/workflow.md`
- `.coding/config.yaml`
- `.coding/spec/**`
- `.coding/scripts/**`
- `.claude/` hooks, settings, agents, skills, and commands

Do not edit by default:

- Global npm install directory
- `node_modules/@limenglin/coding`
- Coding GitHub repository source code
- Concrete state files under `.coding/.runtime/**`
- Hash contents inside `.coding/.template-hashes.json`

Switch to the Coding CLI source-code perspective only when the user explicitly wants to contribute upstream.
